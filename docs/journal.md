### Project Summary

The n8n ServiceDesk Plus node has been successfully enhanced with:
- 4 new operations (addReply, getTicket, listTickets, getConversations)
- 6 AI-accessible tools for intelligent automation
- Advanced reply functionality with message targeting
- Comprehensive error handling and type safety
- Complete documentation suite

**Status: PROJECT COMPLETED** ðŸŽ‰

## Usage Examples

### Reply to First Message
```json
{
  "operation": "addReply",
  "ticketId": "12345",
  "replyContent": "Thank you for your request. We are investigating the issue.",
  "replyToMessage": "first",
  "isPublic": true
}
```

### Get Ticket Details
```json
{
  "operation": "getTicket",
  "ticketId": "12345"
}
```

### List Open Tickets
```json
{
  "operation": "listTickets",
  "limit": 20,
  "statusFilter": "Open"
}
```

## Security Considerations

- âœ… Maintained existing credential management
- âœ… HTTPS agent with certificate validation disabled (as per original)
- âœ… Proper input validation and sanitization
- âœ… No sensitive data exposure in error messages

## Performance Notes

- Reply functionality requires 2 API calls (get conversations + add reply)
- Conversation retrieval optimized for target message identification
- Efficient error handling prevents unnecessary API calls
- Configurable limits prevent excessive data retrieval
